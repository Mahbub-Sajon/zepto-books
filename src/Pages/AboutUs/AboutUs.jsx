        {" "}
        At Zepto Books, we truly feel that books are so much more than compiled
        pages; they are passports to other worlds, guiding posts for
        inspiration, and containers of knowledge. Every book should hold within
        its depths the magic to take us away, even to lands across the world,
        introduce us to fantastic characters, and teach us lessons worth a
        treasure. It is this bond between reader and book that nurtures our love
        of literature. Basically, the philosophy of Zepto Books was to weed out
        and publish quality literary works within reach of every stratum of
        society. Our mission statement was undertaken in a way that we ensured
        provision of vast dispensation of books, which lead to inspiring,
        educating, and entertaining. We know each reader is unique and different
        and has certain tastes and preferences--the most valuable reason we try
        our best to offer something for everyone, be it a novel of throngs, a
        heart-touching story, or an informative non-fiction.
